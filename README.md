### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Paul and I am a Data Scientist with a master's degree in Cognitive Systems from the University of Potsdam. The program is specialized in machine learning and deep learning techniques in the field of natural language processing. As a student, you are not limited to these areas and so I was able to successfully complete my master thesis in Computer Vision (Visual Question Answering). 

My main experience is in Python, but I also have all the activities necessary to use the ML models (Docker, FastAPI, React, Flask). In addition, I am highly motivated to learn about data stream and integration modules (Spark, Kafka).
I am currently interested in open positions as a Python developer, machine learning engineer, and data scientist.

Projects I'm currently working on:

- Automatization of the customs clearance process with graph databases, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and word embedding techniques like Fasttext, TF Universal Sentence Encoder, and Bert.
